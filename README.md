# DOS2- Stats Scripts
These are scripts used to "export" stats file from the DOS2 engine into a csv format, which can be converted back into the stats file once edited with Excel or Python. 
Mainly for the purpose of editing, organizing or dupicating existing entries since the stats editor within the engine is not great for these tasks.
Added a GUI with the two scripts combined.
