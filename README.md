# DOS2-Scripts
These are scripts used to "export" my stats file from the DOS2 engine into a csv file which I would then convert back into the stats file once finished editing with Excel or such. 
Mainly for the purpose of editing, organizing or dupicating existing entries since using the stats editor within the engine was not great for these.
Current only for Stats subfolder, but will be adding all of the other folders later. (SkillData, StatusData, etc.)
